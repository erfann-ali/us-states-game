Hello Everyone

This is a game called US States Game 

This game will create a screen with US map as a background and ask user to enter a state name. If the user input matched with US state name in 50_states.csv, then the input state will
go to their own x and y. If the user input does not match, then it will keep asking user to enter another state.

If user has entered all the states they know and they cannot provide anymore states, then user can enter keyword "Exit" to exit the game.

After all, the game will create a csv file that contains all the states that user did not enter while playing the game, so user can see what are the states they missed. 

Hope you all enjoy this game and learn all 50 states in US.
